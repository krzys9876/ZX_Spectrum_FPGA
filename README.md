# ZX_Spectrum_FPGA
FPGA simplified replica of ZX Spectrum with VGA output. A dump of the Xilinx ISE project, pure Verilog.

This is a simple logical replica of ZX Spectrum. I used a TV80 FPGA logics for Z80 (https://opencores.org/projects/tv80).
The project was build for Mimas Spartan 6 board by Numato Labs.

I modified the original ZX82 ROM to enable serial communication with PC over USB-UART bridge.
